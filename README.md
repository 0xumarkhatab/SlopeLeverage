## Purpose 
A DeFi platform that uses Linear Bonding curve at it's core to buy and sell tokens.
Essentially a Dcentralized Trading platform ( Mini Version ).

## How It Works ( Big Picture )?
The person who buys tokens first and holds it for some time , can sell it at higher prices.

After each Purchase , the token price `increases` by 1 MATIC.
After each Sell , the token price `drops` by 1 MATIC.
So you have to be a clever player.

## DeFi concepts that you will learn
    
    âœ” Tokenization
    âœ” ERC20

## Tutorial ( How to make one ? )
This tutorial will guide you how to build a Slope Leverage app by yourself.

### Pre-requisite

-   Install VSCode
-   Install and Configure Metamask
-   Install Node JS
-   Basic understanding of how a React or Next JS work

With all set , let's start it up.

#### Creating a Next App

First of all We need a `Next Js app` in which we will do everything at our own !
so 

        Create a new folder
        Open that in VScode
        Open your terminal by pressing ``` CTRL + ` ``` on your keyboard
        write "npx create-next-app slope_leverage" in the terminal
        Allow ( tap "y" ) for every step except installing Typescript , we will just be working in javascript.
        Let everything install.
        Test the demo app by writing ` npm run dev ` in the terminal.
        Visit localhost:3000 and you can see the demo app running.
        Congratulations for setting up the app ðŸŽ‰
