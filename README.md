## Purpose 
A DeFi platform that uses Linear Bonding curve at it's core to buy and sell tokens.
Essentially a Dcentralized Trading platform ( Mini Version ).

## How It Works ( Big Picture )?
The person who buys tokens first and holds it for some time , can sell it at higher prices.

After each Purchase , the token price `increases` by 1 MATIC.
After each Sell , the token price `drops` by 1 MATIC.
So you have to be a clever player.
